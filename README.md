### Notes for analysis in Vollger et al., 2023

The workflow can be run using `run.sh` however annotation files and additional inputs must be downloaded and absolute paths in `config.yaml` updated.

#### Annotation files

#### Additional inputs:
Additional inputs used in `config.yaml` can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6792653).
